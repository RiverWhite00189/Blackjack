## Blackjack

This program runs a simple game of blackjack where you the player try to beat the dealer.
You will draw cards until you think your cards have a greater value than those of the dealer; However, you cannot exceed 21 points.

## Card Values
Ace - 11 or 1 | 
Face Cards  - 10 |
2 - 10 cards - their respective numerical value

## Why was this Developed?

This project is my first attempt at making something notable using Java.
This program was inspired by a Reddit post where a user explained that the first thing they would try to make using a new programming language is a game of blackjack in the command line and then one using a GUI.
Development was guided by a video tutorial by Kenny Yip Coding. 
I downloaded Java and Visual Studio Code for the first time. I began to explore how to set up a project and start making something with the programming I learned in AP Computer Science A.
This was my first experience working with a GUI in Java. I found it fairly similar to HTML and CSS, so it wasn't as daunting as I expected.
Unlike the website I made in 9th grade, I wanted this code to be backed up somewhere I could access later in case something happened to my PC. 
I learned how to set up Git and connect Visual Studio Code to GitHub.

## Potential Additions
- betting system
- more interesting card designs
- better UI
- more text-based information of game details
