## Blackjack

This program runs a simple game of blackjack where you, the player, try to beat the dealer.
You will draw cards until you think your cards have a greater value than those of the dealer; However, you cannot exceed 21 points.

## Card Values
Ace - 11 or 1 | 
Face Cards  - 10 |
2 - 10 cards - their respective numerical value

## New Stuff!

This was the first time I downloaded Java, Visual Studio Code, Git/Github, and worked with a GUI!

## Why was this Developed?

This project is the first thing I made after taking AP Computer Science A as I wanted to do more "exciting things" with Java.  
Unlike the website I made in 9th grade.... I wanted this code to be backed up somewhere.   
I was inspired by a Reddit post where a user explained that the first thing they would try to make using a new programming language is a game of blackjack in the command line, and then one using a GUI.  

## Additions!
- New Game Button << DONE
- A betting system <-- current WIP
- Alternative card design menu <-- current WIP
- Nicer UI
- Menu for game details


# Note:
  - Development was guided by a video tutorial by Kenny Yip Coding. (I didn't just make my first proper program out of thin air :/)
  - Don't worry! I added a lot of new stuff, and changed it up a lot! All add-ons are not based on any tutorial (it's 100% me :>)
